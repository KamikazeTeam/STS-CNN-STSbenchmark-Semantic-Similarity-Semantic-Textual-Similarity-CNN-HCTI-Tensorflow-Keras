## Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of paper "HCTI at SemEval-2017 Task 1: Use convolutional neural network to evaluate semantic textual similarity." 
https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S17-2016

A simple CNN approach to get semantic textual similarity scores is proposed in the paper, which got the 3rd place in SemEval-2017 task 1. 
This implementation is based on python 3.5/Tensorflow 1.7.0/Keras 1.2.2 and can achieve over 0.77 on STSbenchmark datasets.

## Training

To train your own model, you need to download GloVe pre-trained word vectors from http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip first and unzip it in your folder.  
To train your CNN model on STSbenchmark datasets:

    python sts.py

## Enjoy!
TODO: 1. Pytorch version
